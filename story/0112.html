                It's been a few days since you were picked up by the notorious Ebony Crew.<br>After striking up a
                bargain with the captain, you've been granted an express trip to the planet M'yutuna... Really, it just
                happened to be the same direction he was heading anyway.<br><br>To pay for your boarding, the
                captain has you and Jujuju doing rather menial tasks usually reserved for slaves and
                lowbloods.<br>You've never scrubbed a ship in your life, at least one that wasn't your own. <br><br>You
                both despise it.<br><br>You had given your coat and boots to Jujuju as you really couldn't get the rest
                of her stuff while you were making your daring escape. At least it will make up for giving away the one
                thing that kept you ahead of the competition. She was not exactly pleased about that.<br><br>Thankfully
                there was a spare hand hook laying around for a replacement for her hand, as customary on pirate
                ships.<br>
                A pirate without a hook is like a king without his crown... which is to say he would be a rather piss
                poor king!<br><br>There's
                still a couple days to go to your next destination and you're starting to get sick of mopping the same
                spot.<br><br>What will you do?

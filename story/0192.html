                You have just finished up a rather lengthy screen chat with your superior and you are NOT in a great
                mood.<br><br>
                Look's like word of Snake's escape has reached the Empress herself and you received the yelling of a
                lifetime for your failure.<br>Certainly not what you needed tonight, you only just finally got the dick
                drawings off your face!<br><br>Your ship is on course towards your private estate that is situated on a
                moon in order to check on one of your prized possessions. You ponder if you should call Rat again to see
                how
                her progress is but you doubt she has
                gotten around to replacing that screen she punched.<br><br>
